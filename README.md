### Classic Arcade Game Submission

This project is for assignment P3 of the UdaCity Front End Web Nano Degree

## Running the Game

[This game can be run from this repository by following this link.] (http://eqpolar.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game/)

You may also download the game to your computer and open the index.html
in your web browser.

If you are interested in changing the difficulty of the game see the instruction in the global.js files.

I am not submitted this project for "above expectation" criteria due to time limits.  I think
a very interesting addition to this project would be to use Firebase to save high scores, and if 
a player choose to sign in with FaceBook keep track of their score history, times played, etc.
